Adds a non-breaking space between words and punctuation marks to avoid inappropriate line-breaks in French.

== Description ==

This plugin adds non-breaking spaces required by the French language in the content, excerpt, comments, text widget, and WooCommerce short description - skipping over pre-formatted code blocks, styles and scripts. 

If the `<!--:fr-->` HTML  tag is found (used by some multilingual plugins), non-breaking spaces are added only between the `<!--:fr-->` and `<!--:-->` HTML tags.

There are no plugin settings - simply *install* and *activate* the plugin.
